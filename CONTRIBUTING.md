## 🧭 Workflow & Standards

We use the **GitFlow** branching model to keep things clean and organized. Here’s a quick overview:

- `main`: stable production-ready code
- `develop`: latest development version
- `feature/*`: new features (branched from `develop`)
- `hotfix/*`: urgent fixes (branched from `main`)
- `release/*`: preparing a release (branched from `develop`)

Make sure your branches follow this naming convention.
