## 🔬 Research Methodology

FormulAI applies proven qualitative research methods powered by AI:

### Grounded Theory
Build insights from the data itself rather than testing pre-existing hypotheses. Themes emerge from actual responses.

### In-Vivo Coding
Extract topics using respondents' exact language, preserving authentic voice and meaning.

### Theoretical Sampling
Intelligently select representative quotes that capture the essence of each theme while maintaining diversity.

### Sentiment Contextualization
Understand not just *what* people say, but *how they feel* about specific topics.

### Correlation Analysis
Discover hidden relationships: topic co-occurrence, topic-sentiment links, answer-topic segmentation.

## ⚡ Performance & Scale

### Speed
- **10 responses**: Analysis in ~30-45 seconds
- **50 responses**: Analysis in ~2-3 minutes
- **100 responses**: Analysis in ~4-6 minutes
- **Real-time updates**: Watch progress live via Server-Sent Events

### Quality
- **Research-Grade Analysis**: Comparable to manual qualitative coding
- **Consistent Categorization**: Same topics labeled consistently across responses
- **Evidence-Based**: Every insight backed by actual quotes
- **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent about certainty levels

### Efficiency
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze 10-25 responses per AI call
